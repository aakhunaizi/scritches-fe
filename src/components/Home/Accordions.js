                  Our sitters have to pass a background check before they are
                  allowed onto the platform. They are normal people who love
                  pets, just like you. They are dedicated to giving your pet a
                  home where they can freely roam and explore, adding up to a
                  day worth barking or meowing about.

                  Scritches was developed to connect pet owners with pet lovers
                  that are dedicated to caring for their pets when they are busy
                  or away through a secure platform. The service fee, a
                  percentage of the service booking, helps us cover costs such
                  as development, marketing, and payment processing of our pet
                  sitters' earnings.
